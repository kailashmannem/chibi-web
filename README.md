A fun, interactive web-based chibi character that animates, reacts to your mouse, and displays a variety of behaviors and states!

<h2>Features</h2>
<hr>
<p>- **Idle & Jump Animation:** Chibi alternates between idle and jump when the mouse is active.</p>
<p>- **Chase & Escape:** If you chase the chibi with your cursor, it runs away in the opposite direction, with movement speed based on your mouse speed.</p>
<p>- **Attack Animation:** When escaping, the chibi performs a random attack animation facing the cursor.</p>
<p>- **Teleportation:** If the chibi reaches the edge of the window, it teleports to a random location.</p>
<p>- **Catch & Hurt:** If you catch the chibi (cursor overlaps the chibi), it plays a hurt animation and resets to the center.</p>
<p>- **Sleep State:** If the mouse is inactive for 5 seconds or leaves the window, the chibi plays a sleep sequence (Idle → Tosleep → Sleeping). On return, it wakes up and resumes normal behavior.</p>
<p>- **Responsive & Pixel-Perfect:** Works with pixel-art spritesheets and is fully responsive.</p>
